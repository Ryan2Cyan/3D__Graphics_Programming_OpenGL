- CP: GLfloat - illegal use of this type as an expression. [solved]
      GLfloat is a typedef of a float, so you can't compare it to an int?
      Yep, you must use GL_FLOAT instead, what's the difference?
      Ah, GLfloat is the typedef (OpenGL version of float) and GL_FLOAT is an enum.
      Hence why GL_FLOAT can be compared with an int, as an enum is an int.
